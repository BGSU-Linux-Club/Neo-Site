          <h2>What does 'Hacker Culture' mean?</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
	  My use of the term 'Hacker' does not mean somebody who cracks security systems or damages digital infrastructure, but rather by its original meaning.
	  a <strong>hack</strong> is a kind of playful, clever solution to a problem, and so a <strong>hacker</strong> is someone who likes to hack.
	  The essence of a 'hack' has nothing really to do with computers, but a hack can be done in a computer-y context.
	</p>
	<p>
	  A well-known hacker, Richard Stallman, details what he thinks is a good example of a hack:

	  I went to lunch with some GNU fans, and was sitting down to eat some tteokbokki (*), when a waitress set down six chopsticks right in front of me. It occurred to me that perhaps these were meant for three people, but it was more amusing to imagine that I was supposed to use all six. I did not know any way to do that, so I realized that if I could come up with a way, it would be a hack. I started thinking. After a few seconds I had an idea.
	  
	  First I used my left hand to put three chopsticks into my right hand. That was not so hard, though I had to figure out where to put them so that I could control them individually. Then I used my right hand to put the other three chopsticks into my left hand. That was hard, since I had to keep the three chopsticks already in my right hand from falling out. After a couple of tries I got it done.
	  
	  Then I had to figure out how to use the six chopsticks. That was harder. I did not manage well with the left hand, but I succeeded in manipulating all three in the right hand. After a couple of minutes of practice and adjustment, I managed to pick up a piece of food using three sticks converging on it from three different directions, and put it in my mouth.
	  
	  It didn't become easyâ€”for practical purposes, using two chopsticks is completely superior. But precisely because using three in one hand is hard and ordinarily never thought of, it has "hack value", as my lunch companions immediately recognized. Playfully doing something difficult, whether useful or not, that is hacking. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  The essence of the hack was that it was a kind of a creative solution to a difficult problem, even if it wasn't the most efficient.
	  A <strong>culture</strong> of hacking is in the spirit of hacking to get things done, and to have fun.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I encourage you to find hacks in your everyday life, whether with computers or not, for fun and for profit :)
